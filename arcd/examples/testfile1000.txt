Russia's attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure amount to genocide, a top Ukrainian official says.
Strikes on key facilities targeted "the full Ukrainian nation" and were an effort to force Kyiv to surrender, the prosecutor-general told the BBC.
The term genocide refers to an effort to wipe out a group of people. Russia denies having any such aim.
Millions of people across Ukraine are facing power cuts in freezing weather, following sustained Russian attacks.
Efforts are ongoing to reconnect homes cut off from electricity. Officials say Kherson has now been fully resupplied, following the city's recapture by Ukrainian troops earlier this month.
